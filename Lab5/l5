1.1) This name choice is horrendous. In C, 1 is true and 0 is false.

1.2) The strcmp() function returns a number > 0 if str1 < str2. It should be < 0 instead. Also, smaller is a bad name as it isn't descriptive. Replace if statement with single return statement.

1.3) Ok. I read it out loud. I sound seriously stupid. The names make no sense.

1.4) 

if (c != 'y' && c != 'Y')

flag = !flag

quote = (*line == '"')

bit = (val & 1)

1.5) The read() function is taking a pointer as a parameter. Therefore, inside scan(), it is taking the address rather than the value of the ip variable.

1.6) 2, 1 for most compilers.

1.7) 

if !(istty(stdin) | istty(stdout) | istty(stderr)) { 
	return 0;
}

return retval

for (k = 0; k < 5; k++){
	x += dx
	scanf("%lf", &dx)
}

1.8) 

for (int count = 0; count < total; count++){
	return (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName());
}

1.9) Parenthesis do not include the entire ternary operator.

1.10) MI should be MILES, KM should be KILOMETERS

1.11) 

Stating the method returns 1 or 0 contradicts the void type setting
