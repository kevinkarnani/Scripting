Assn 2 (Cash Register)

1. Please, before running ./assn4, run `make build` or `make test`.
2. Also, every time you run ./test.script, you need to run `make test`. This is because to properly test the exit code of 4, state.json must not be present.
3. If you are seeing this README, you are seeing my second submission. The only difference between my submissions is an edit so that `test` depends on `build`.

EDIT (For Kurt!!):

I am submitting this on 3/19/2020 due to the submission error.
As I read the output of `ls -o`, I noticed it was giving a "Permission Denied" for the assn4 file. However, it still listed it out along with the respective perms.
I do not know how, but somehow everyone only gets execute permissions. I know for a fact I used chmod 755 for the assn4 file.
Additionally, I was testing till the very end with make commands, so as for how the permissions changed, I truly have no idea.
I am completely unable to open up the file right now, which wasn't the case earlier.
