Lab 9

1.1) SegmentationError thrown. A "core" file was created (a log file telling us where the compiler crashed).

1.2) inTable()

1.3)
	c) The program failed at line 79, which goes back to line 58. After looking at line 50, I noticed that the numLines was being incremented first.
		As such, I fixed the program by switching the incrementation with the assignment that followed it initially.
	e) It seems the calculator doesn't perform subtraction properly. "5 3 -" returns "-2", so it is subtracting the wrong way.
		To fix this, at line 47, switch the subtraction order.
	f) Assert that the pivots are randomized properly, then assert that the pivot indeed changes. 
		The problem was it used the left side instead of the right side of the pivot. Change v + last - 1 to + 1 in line 35.

1.4) Compilers cannot detect all errors. Design/Logic errors are prime examples. Compilers cannot detect a flawed implementation/

1.5) The program runs... however, strcmp() converts the integers to strings and compares them lexically. This is an undesired output.
