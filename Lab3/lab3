Lab 3

1) true because 13 starts with 1, which is lexically less than 2
2) "All we have to decide is what to do with the chocolate that is given us..." because chocolate was found in mySettings and redirected to /dev/null successfully
3) 2 because the let operator does integer arithmetic, meaning division is actually floor division. Since 13/5 = 2r3, (( 13/5 )) = 2
4) 0 because echo $? gives us the exit status of the previous command, and the previous command was successful
5) "5 12 13" and "5  13". They are different because the first command was run in a subshell, and changes in a subshell do not persist in the parent shell
6) Item \n Another \n Item
7) Item \n Another Item
8) Item \n Another Item
9) see count.bash
10) see reextend
11) see organiseMusic
